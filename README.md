# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I'm a PhD genomic bioinformatician with a passion for open science and FAIR data.
My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods for analyzing genomic data.
I am particularly interested in using open-source tools and workflows to ensure reproducibility and facilitate data sharing.

I am an Nextflow ambassador and active member of the nf-core community, where I contribute to the development of best practices for next-generation sequencing data analysis.

On my GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects related to my research but also some personal projects:

- [**`nf-core/phaseimpute`**](https://nf-co.re/phaseimpute/) pipelines to impute genomic data 
- [**`Pedixplorer`**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Pedixplorer.html) bioconductor project with:
  - Its [dedicated documentation website](https://louislenezet.github.io/Pedixplorer/)
  - Its [dedicated Shiny app](https://pedixplorer.univ-rennes.fr/) available on the Rennes' University VM
- [louislenezet.github.io](https://louislenezet.github.io/) My personal jekyll website to host and showcase my work
  - My articles, with their graph scripts, but also my posters and CV will be soon available there.
- [`BioShinyModules`](https://github.com/stjude-biohackathon/BioShinyModules) that I hope will in the near future be available in Bioconductor
- `Files2DB` an ongoing project to automatically aggregate, normalise data
- [autoCatFeeder](https://github.com/LouisLeNezet/autoCatFeeder) a little project for a cheap automatic cat's croquette feeder.
With wood work, 3D printing and a bit of arduino

I welcome feedback and contributions on any of my porjects. By working together we go further !
