# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm a PhD genomic bioinformatician with a passion for open science and FAIR data. My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods for analyzing genomic data. I am particularly interested in using open-source tools and workflows to ensure reproducibility and facilitate data sharing.

I am an active member of the nf-core community, where I contribute to the development of best practices for next-generation sequencing data analysis.

On my GitHub page, you'll find a variety of projects related to my research, including pipelines for processing and analyzing genomic data and some personnal project. I believe in the power of collaboration and welcome feedback and contributions from the community. Let's work together to advance genomic research and promote open science!
